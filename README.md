# AI Agent-Based Educational Content Generator

## Description
This project is an AI agent-based educational content generator built using Python and Streamlit.

The system demonstrates how multiple agents can work together:
- A Generator Agent creates educational explanations and MCQs.
- A Reviewer Agent evaluates the generated content for quality and completeness.

AI tools were used as a learning and productivity aid to understand agent-based workflows and improve implementation efficiency. The overall logic, structure, and integration were implemented by me.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit

## Project Structure
- app.py – Streamlit UI and main application
- generator.py – Generator Agent logic
- reviewer.py – Reviewer Agent logic

## How to Run
```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
